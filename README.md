# Blog [![Build Status](https://github.com/statox/blog/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/statox/blog/actions/)

I'm trying to do a minimal blog hoping that having it very simple will motivate me to put new stuff regularly.
For now the rest of this readme will probably be my cheatsheet/todo list.

# Tools used

- The [newcss](https://newcss.net/) css framework.
- The [eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator.

# Commands

## Develop site locally.

The following command will watch the files, generate the site in the `docs/` directory and serve it locally.

    npm run dev

## Generate the site

    npm run build

Will build the site in `docs/` which is served by github pages. (This is actually done by the CI)

## Publishing the site

Github pages serves the `gh-pages` branch. The deployment is automated with Github Actions. (The job is [here](https://github.com/statox/blog/actions/))

In [`.deploy.yml`](https://github.com/statox/blog/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy.yml) I use the github pages provider which does the following:

 - Install everything
 - Use `npm run build` to generate the site in the `docs/` directory
 - Checkout the result on the `gh-pages` branch

## Analytics

To do analytics I use [goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) because it respects user's privacy and that's important.
The dashboard is here https://statoxblog.goatcounter.com/

## Notes

`_includes/layouts` contains the structure which is used in templates like `index.html` or `posts.html`.

The template syntax is [nunjucks](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/languages/nunjucks/) because so far it seems to be the easieest but maybe I'll change that.
