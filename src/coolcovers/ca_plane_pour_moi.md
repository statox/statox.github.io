title: "Ca plane pour moi - The Presidents Of The United States Of America vs. Plastic Bertrand"
---

When an American punk band from the 90s make a cover of an eccentric Belgian punk from the 70s the result is dumb, messy and a ton of fun!

Clearly The Presidents never took a lesson of French but they completely understood the energy of the song, the classical shuffle riff they aggressively added makes a cover a wonderful mix of retro rock&roll and 90s punk bands like the Offsring and NoFX, a masterpiece.
