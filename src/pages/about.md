### Hello

I am Adrien (aka statox), a server software engineer at [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) in Paris, France.

<img class="profile-picture" src="{{ '/images/me.jpg' | url }}" alt="My face"/>

This website is just a place for me to talk a bit about my side projects and keep a few notes for myself. You will find stuff about the topics that I like (in no particular order): Vim, Linux and system administration, doing fun simulations and games in the browser, DIY projects, improving people's privacy on the internet and software development in general.

### Social

You can email me at <code>me AT statox DOT fr</code> or reach out to me on any of these social platforms:

- [Github](https://github.com/statox/) - Where I host my side projects and experiments.
- [vi.stackexchange](https://vi.stackexchange.com/users/1841/statox) - Where I've been a moderator for a few years and try to be helpful to other Vim users.
- [Linked in](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adrien-fabre-7a30994b/) - Where you can contact me if you want to.

### Technology on this site

#### Analytics

Because I want to be able to know how many people read my rambling I use an analytics platform on this website.

However I think the fight for a more privacy friendly internet is one of the most important to lead currently. That's why I use [goatcounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/): It is an amazing privacy friendly tool which does nothing else than counting how many time my pages are loaded. So no cookie :cookie: for you on this site, nor any other invasive tracking method.

#### Web

My professional experience is mainly focused on backend development: Maintaining and developing infrastructures at scale is a fascinating topic for me, however I'm less used to frontend development. So when I started creating a website I wanted it to be dead simple so that I get things done quickly and without friction. That's why I chose to use [eleventy](https://11ty.dev/) a simpler static site generator.

And as I'm not exactly a css expert and wanted something simpler than bootstrap I went with [newcss](https://newcss.net/) a very simple css framework.

The source code of the site is [on Github](https://github.com/statox/blog/) and [uses Github Actions](../posts/others/travis-to-githubactions/) to automatically build and publish each update to Github Pages.
